Game Designer, Developer, Musician, Creative, Entreprenur, Dreamer.

Born and raised at South East of London. I was interested in video games and computers before I was inspired by my uncle, Eric Bailey's <i>(The Incredible Hulk 1994, Black and White, Live for Speed)</i> career as a illustrator/designer/animator in the video games industry to pursue my own dreams to become a renown video game designer.

During my years in university, I taken part at GameJams where I collaborated and learnt from different developers from other universities. As a Sound Designer/Programmer in one of the projects, I created sound effects and composed two pieces of music with different texture layers that plays alongside each other based on the game's progression. After using the audio engine to implement the sound effects and music, I was able to adapt to the team's coding practices to implement my audio code into the game. That effort earned me a Best Sound award and my contribution got us 2nd place in the GameJam.

During my hiatus away from the industry, I dedicated myself to learn front-end web development and refresh my previous knowledge in Unity3D. Furthermore, I have learnt the importance of working together as a team under a single goal without friction and being able to endure pressure based on current demands while knowing where my boundries lie. That endurance helped my resolve to push forward to complete the task at hand.

Game Designer, Developer, Musician, Creative, Entreprenur, Dreamer.

Born and raised at South East of London who was inspired by his uncle, Eric Bailey's <i>(The Incredible Hulk 1994, Black and White, Life for Speed)</i> career as a illustrator/designer/animator in the video games industry to pursue his own dreams to become a known video game designer.

Started without any GCSEs, he went from Level 1 BTEC Introductory Diploma in IT @ Work to completed his BA(hons) in Game Design with first class honours. The journey of video games development appeared to be a lengthy one without any signs of progression. With the competetion of the industy heated up with little chances of entry, the IT industry became a focal point to improve his software development skills.

And so begins the journey of self-learning from different learning platform including Udacity to the point where he felt complaent to pursue his ambitions further in this IT industry and by extension the games industry.
